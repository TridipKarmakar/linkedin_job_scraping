With our powerful combination of the leading platform technology, patient-friendly devices, and trusted support, we are pioneering how medical groups use technology and real-time data to treat patients' health outside the practice walls. As the most trusted and experienced remote care vendor in the industry, we simplify the complexities of delivering effective, high-quality remote patient monitoring and optimize our clients’ clinical and financial performance.\\n\\nWhy now? Optimize Health has been around for a few years, but as our ambitions for improving and expanding our product grow, we’re now ready for our engineering team to expand considerably too. We are seeking to help us integrate more partners’ systems with ours, introducing new data to store and exchange, while ensuring the system can continue scaling well with our ever-growing population of users.\\n\\nToday Optimize Health offers a platform for remote care of patients, collecting readings from devices and assisting clinicians in analyzing and acting upon that data, watching over their patients to keep them healthy and happy. Within the medical field, information management still takes place across archipelagos of segregated systems, relying on human toil—and its attendant drudgery and fallibility—to ferry between them. Optimize Health aims to bridge these divides, making it easier and safer for clinicians to offer more integrated care options to their patients—with a service that continues to feel fast and reliable.

Being familiar with those items that follow is helpful, but more important is you being interested in the menu as an opportunity to learn. This is what we’re using today, and any of it could change.

We simplify effective remote care and reduce the administrative and financial hurdles in order to improve patient outcomes, lower hospitalizations, and reduce patient expenses.\\n\\nWe believe healthcare technology should be designed for the patient and provider. That’s why we created an elegant remote care platform, along with monitoring services, designed to offer the best experience possible for healthcare workers and patients.
